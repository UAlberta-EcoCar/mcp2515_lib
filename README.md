# mcp2515_lib
A C library for using the mcp2515 CAN controller with an atmega328p.
Based off code found at http://www.kreatives-chaos.com/artikel/ansteuerung-eines-mcp2515 which is why some chunks of code are commented in German.
I focused more on reducing compiled code size and keeping things simple than on adding functionality (ex: auto baudrate detection would be cool)
