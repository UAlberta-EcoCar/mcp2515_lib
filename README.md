# mcp2515_lib
A C/C++ library for using the [MCP2515 CAN controller] (http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21801e.pdf) with an atmega328p.
Based off code found at http://www.kreatives-chaos.com/artikel/ansteuerung-eines-mcp2515 which is why some chunks of code are commented in German.
Focus was made on making the library as light weight as possible and making the code simple to understand. It lacks error checking required for reliable CAN Bus communication.
